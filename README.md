# 2016FallSpeechProj
Speech Emotion Recognition Project for Speech Processing Class in Autumn 2016

# Prepare Data
Download Datadir emotiondetection from FTP as emotiondetection
Enter the emotiondetection and extract the compressed files, expecially the one named ##features_labels_lld.zip##

! Attention:
--------------------------------------------------
we mainly use $Python$ to complete this project.  
For better cooperation, I strongly recommend this programming style:

And for convenience, I use 1 tabstop to replace 4 blank space by setting tabstop=4 in vim.
