# About 2016FallSpeechProj
Speech Emotion Recognition Project for Speech Processing Class in Autumn 2016
--------------------------------------------------

# Prepare Data

## Get them
1. Download Data directory **emotiondetection** from FTP as **emotiondetection**;
2. Enter the **emotiondetection**;
3. Extract the compressed files, expecially the one named **features_labels_lld.zip**;

## More info
1. lld_train(test)_feat(label).scp contain information about where the feature and label file is.
2. We will not contain data in this repository for the sake of space and speed. But **please update the information about what features you use in this Readme**;

! Attention:
--------------------------------------------------
we mainly use $Python$ to complete this project.  
For better cooperation, I strongly recommend this programming style:

And for convenience, I use 1 tabstop to replace 4 blank space by setting tabstop=4 in vim.
